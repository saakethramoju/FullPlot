"""
2D Dataset as Multiple Line Traces
==================================

This example plots one 2D HDF5 dataset as several 1D line traces.

The HDF5 group is:

    /maps

The dataset is:

    pressure_map[station, time]

with shape:

    (6, 501)

This means:

    axis 0 = station, length 6
    axis 1 = time,    length 501

The plot call uses:

    y="pressure_map"
    x="time"
    axis=-1

The key argument is axis=-1.

In Python and NumPy, axis=-1 means "the last axis". For pressure_map, the last
axis is time. Therefore FullPlot plots along the time direction.

The remaining axis, station, becomes separate traces. So the result is:

    Station 0.0 pressure versus time
    Station 0.2 pressure versus time
    Station 0.4 pressure versus time
    Station 0.6 pressure versus time
    Station 0.8 pressure versus time
    Station 1.0 pressure versus time

This is the line-plot version of the same 2D data used in the heat-map example.

Run 0generate_plotting_data.py first if plotting_demo.h5 does not exist.
