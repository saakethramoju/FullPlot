Heat Map from Separate 1D Datasets
==================================

This example makes a heat map from several separate 1D datasets.

Some HDF5 files store data like this:

    station_1_pressure[time]
    station_2_pressure[time]
    station_3_pressure[time]
    ...

instead of storing one 2D array like this:

    pressure_map[station, time]

FullPlot can still make a heat map. When z is a list of 1D datasets, FullPlot
stacks them internally in the order provided:

    z=[station_1_pressure,
       station_2_pressure,
       station_3_pressure,
       ...]

becomes:

    stacked_pressure[station, time]

This example is useful for exported solver data where each sensor, node, or
station is saved as its own time history.

Run 0generate_plotting_data.py first if plotting_demo.h5 does not exist.
