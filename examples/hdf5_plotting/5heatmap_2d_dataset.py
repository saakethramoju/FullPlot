Heat Map from a 2D Dataset
==========================

This example plots a true 2D HDF5 dataset as a heat map.

The HDF5 group is:

    /maps

The relevant datasets are:

    time          shape (501,)
    station       shape (6,)
    pressure_map  shape (6, 501)

The 2D pressure dataset is arranged as:

    pressure_map[station, time]

That means:

    axis 0 = station direction
    axis 1 = time direction

The map call means:

    x-axis = time
    y-axis = station
    color  = pressure_map[station, time]

A heat map is often the clearest way to view a 2D field because the third
quantity is represented by color.

Run 0generate_plotting_data.py first if plotting_demo.h5 does not exist.
